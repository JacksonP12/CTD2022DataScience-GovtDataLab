I chose this dataset because I was interested in the household situations of American students (though the dataset primarily focuses on very young children and their parents). I chose the specific column that I did because I was interested in the economic situations of the families of these students. It turns out that most American families have a household income of about $75,000 to $100,000, with some families having a smaller income and a few having a higher income. I think that comparing this data against the grades of the students in these households would certainly be interesting, and I hypothesize that the higher income families generally have better performing students, as they would have more resources to give them more options when it comes to achieving their goals.
